tmng-setup-tools
================

A small library of utility functions designed to setup necessary development
tools for the TMNG team at T-Mobile. This package was designed to be installed in the
node modules folder at the project root. From there it parses the required "globals"
field in the package.json looking for all packages to install.
It was designed to be largely idempotent. That is, after the the system is properly configured,
no new modifications will be made. It will prompt for updates when updates for certain packages become
available, and it uses the semantic versions in the globals field to identify the correct versions to install.
